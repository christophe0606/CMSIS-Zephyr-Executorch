config EXECUTORCH_METHOD_ALLOCATOR_POOL_SIZE
	int "Method allocator pool size in bytes"
	default 262144
	help
	  Size of the method allocator pool in bytes. This memory is used
	  for allocating ExecuTorch method instances, inputs, outputs, and
	  their metadata. Default is 256KB which should be sufficient for
	  most small to medium models. Larger models may require more memory.

config EXECUTORCH_TEMP_ALLOCATOR_POOL_SIZE
	int "Temporary allocator pool size in bytes"
	default 1572864
	help
	  Size of the temporary allocator pool in bytes (tensor arena). This
	  memory is used for temporary allocations during model execution
	  including intermediate tensor calculations and Ethos-U scratch memory.
	  Default is 1.5MB which should be sufficient for typical Ethos-U
	  delegated models. Complex models may require more memory.
